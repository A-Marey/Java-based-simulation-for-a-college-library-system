 A Java-based simulation of a college library system where students borrow textbooks, study, and eventually graduate when their library card expires. The project simulates a real-world library environment with features to track the borrowing, studying, and progress of individual students. It uses object-oriented principles to manage student and library behaviors, making it a great example of both software design and implementation in Java.

Features:

Simulates student borrowing and studying activities.
Tracks student progress and lifecycle until graduation.
Object-oriented design with classes for Student and College environments.
Step-by-step time advancement to simulate real-world scenarios.
